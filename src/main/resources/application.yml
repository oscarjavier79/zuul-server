# What will be sent to the gallery service is what comes after the path defined,
# So, if request is "/gallery/view/1", gallery service will get "/view/1".
# In case of auth, we need to pass the "/auth/" in the path to auth service. So, set strip-prefix to false


# Exclude authorization from sensitive headers
